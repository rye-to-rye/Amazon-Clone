# Amazon Clone – JavaScript Project

This project is a front-end Amazon-style e-commerce clone built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It focuses on recreating core e-commerce functionality while keeping the codebase modular, readable, and scalable.

## Features

- Amazon-style product listings
- Dynamic rendering of products using JavaScript
- Interactive shopping cart logic
- Real-time UI updates via DOM manipulation
- Modular JavaScript architecture
- Clean separation of structure, style, and logic
- Version control using Git and GitHub

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – page structure
- **CSS** – layout and styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – application logic and interactivity

## Key Concepts Implemented

- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, strings, numbers, booleans)
- Conditional logic and control flow
- Functions and advanced function patterns
- Objects and object-oriented programming
- Arrays and loops
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- ES modules for code organization
- External libraries
- Testing and testing frameworks
- Classes and inheritance
- Asynchronous JavaScript:
  - Callbacks
  - Promises
  - fetch
  - async / await
- Introductory backend concepts (conceptual)

## Project Structure

- HTML handles structure and layout
- CSS manages styling and responsiveness
- JavaScript controls state, logic, and user interaction
- Modular files used to improve maintainability and scalability

## Purpose

This project demonstrates my ability to build a realistic front-end application using vanilla JavaScript. It shows an understanding of modern JavaScript patterns, project organization, and interactive UI development without relying on frameworks.
